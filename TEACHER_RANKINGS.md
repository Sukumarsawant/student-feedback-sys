# 🏆 Teacher Rankings Feature

## Overview

Added a comprehensive teacher rankings/leaderboard system to the teacher dashboard that shows:
- Current teacher's rank among all teachers
- Current teacher's average rating
- Top 10 performing teachers
- Real-time rankings based on student feedback

---

## Features

### 1. **Your Performance Summary**
- **Your Rank**: Current position (e.g., #3 out of 15 teachers)
- **Your Rating**: Average rating from student feedback (e.g., 4.85/5.00)
- Prominently displayed at the top of the rankings section

### 2. **Top 10 Leaderboard**
- 🥇 Gold medal for #1
- 🥈 Silver medal for #2  
- 🥉 Bronze medal for #3
- Numbered ranking for positions 4-10
- Shows:
  - Teacher name
  - Department
  - Number of responses
  - Average rating with star icon
  - Response count

### 3. **Current Teacher Highlighting**
- Your entry is highlighted with:
  - Indigo background
  - Ring border
  - "(You)" label
  - Increased prominence

### 4. **Ellipsis for Lower Ranks**
- If current teacher ranks below #10, shows:
  - Top 10 teachers
  - "• • •" separator
  - Current teacher's entry at the bottom

### 5. **No Rating State**
- Shows informative message if teacher hasn't received ratings yet
- Encourages getting student feedback

---

## How It Works

### Data Collection:
1. Fetches all feedback responses with teacher_id
2. Joins with profiles to get teacher names and departments
3. Extracts rating answers from feedback_answers
4. Calculates average rating per teacher
5. Counts total responses per teacher

### Ranking Logic:
```typescript
// Calculate average ratings
const avgRating = totalRatings / responseCount;

// Sort teachers by rating (descending)
teacherRankings.sort((a, b) => b.avg_rating - a.avg_rating);

// Assign ranks (1, 2, 3, ...)
teacherRankings.forEach((teacher, index) => {
  teacher.rank = index + 1;
});
```

### Display Logic:
- **Top 10**: Always shown (if available)
- **Current Teacher**:
  - If in top 10: Highlighted in leaderboard
  - If below top 10: Shown after "• • •" separator
  - If no ratings: Shows informational message

---

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme:
- **Background**: Indigo gradient (from-indigo-50 to-blue-50)
- **Current Teacher**: Indigo-100 with indigo-400 ring
- **Top 3**: Amber/yellow gradient background
- **Others**: White background
- **Ratings**: Amber star icon with numeric value

### Layout:
```

## Database Query

```typescript
const { data: allTeacherRatings } = await supabase
  .from('feedback_responses')
  .select(`
    teacher_id,
    profiles!feedback_responses_teacher_id_fkey (
      full_name,
      department
    ),
    feedback_answers!inner (
      answer_rating
    )
  `)
  .not('teacher_id', 'is', null);
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization:
- Single query fetches all data
- Client-side aggregation and sorting
- Cached for page duration
- Could be cached longer with revalidation

### Future Improvements:
1. **Materialized View**: Pre-calculate rankings in database
2. **Caching**: Cache rankings for 5-10 minutes
3. **Pagination**: For universities with 100+ teachers
4. **Filtering**: By department, semester, course type
5. **Historical Tracking**: Show rank changes over time

---

## Gamification Elements

### Current:
- 🥇🥈🥉 Medals for top 3
- Highlighted current teacher
- Star ratings with visual appeal
- Competitive leaderboard

### Potential Additions:
- **Badges**: "Rising Star", "Consistent Performer", "Student Favorite"
- **Streaks**: "Top 5 for 3 months in a row"
- **Achievements**: "First 100 ratings", "Perfect 5.0 rating"
- **Trends**: ↑ Improving, ↓ Declining, → Stable
- **Department Rankings**: Best in department
- **Course-Specific**: Highest rated course
